# Web-Developer-Challenge
This project creats a 1-page application that leverages a public API: Open Library. 
This webpage lets the user search a book title or key word and a series of results gets displayed based
on the data from the Open Library.

2. I used the Open Library API because it didn't require an API KEY. Also, it has a lot of information
on different books as well as their authors, publication, language and date of publication. 
3. Other applications other than searching include sorting. There are multiple different ways to sort.
First, we can sort by the title of the book:Alphabetic and unalphabetical. We can also filter by Title, author,
publish year, publication and language and see if a certain value contains a key. This is useful if you're
searching for a specific common titled book with a certain author. You can also hide the title tab if that 
is irrelevant to your search. 
4. Some of the considerations to make the website responsible and mobile friendly is 

5. Some ways I can make my app accessible for people with disabilities such as blindness and color blindness, I 
can provide sufficient contrast using colors and textures as well as using descriptive labels for links and
buttons. I would also implement easy keyboard accessibility.
6. Some changes I could make to make my webpage more presentable is adding more color. I could also make
the colum a little longer to display more results at once.
